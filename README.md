### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tiaan Kemp

Iâ€™m a passionate and curious learner with a strong foundation in technology, project management, and practical leadership.  
I combine academic knowledge with hands-on experience gained from diverse training programs and real-world problem-solving.

### Iâ€™m currently working on:
- A university project involving monitoring of generators and displaying their diagnostics on a dashboard, as well as utilising AI for optimisations
- Java-based web systems with authentication, PostgreSQL integration, and full MVC architecture  
- IoT security and MQTT broker communication

### Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Full-stack web development with JavaScript, Node.js, Express & MongoDB/PostgreSQL  
- Java Servlets, JSP, and Maven for enterprise-grade applications  
- Machine Learning & AI fundamentals (including data preprocessing, EDA, and model evaluation)  

### Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source tools for student wellness, education, or smart city solutions  
- Beginner-friendly projects involving Java, Python, or web technologies  
- Tech-for-good or community-focused initiatives

### Iâ€™m looking for help with:
- Best practices in scalable backend architecture  
- DevOps and deployment strategies (CI/CD, Docker, etc.)  
- Optimizing AI/ML models for edge/IoT devices

### Ask me about:
- Project-based learning, leadership development, and hands-on survival/life skills  
- Secure communication between IoT brokers  
- Building RESTful APIs and managing databases in full-stack apps
